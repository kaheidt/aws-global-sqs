# Conversation with Amazon Q: Building a Global SQS Solution

## Initial Request

**Human**: I want to create a .net application that sends messages to SQS, but leverages sigv4a to be agnostic as to which SQS regional endpoint the message is being sent to. I want to control the SQS region destination via route53. I also want the app to monitor SQS queues in us-east-1 as well as us-west-2 in order show the arrival of the message in either region. There should be route53 weighted rules that send to us-east-1 with a failover to us-west-2. The app needs the ability to toggle those failovers so that we can demonstrate the message arriving at us-west-2. The part of the app producing the message should be unaware of any routing activity or failing over.

**Amazon Q**: I'll help you create a .NET application that sends messages to SQS using SigV4a for multi-region flexibility, with Route53 handling the routing. Let's break this down into components and implement them step by step.

First, let's explore the project structure to see what we're working with.

I see this is a new repository with just Git files. Let's create a .NET solution with the necessary components for your requirements. Here's my plan:

1. Create a .NET solution with multiple projects:
   - Producer: Sends messages to SQS using SigV4a
   - Consumer: Monitors SQS queues in both regions
   - Common: Shared code and models
   - Infrastructure: IaC for AWS resources (Route53, SQS)

2. Set up the AWS infrastructure:
   - SQS queues in us-east-1 and us-west-2
   - Route53 weighted routing rules
   - IAM roles and policies

3. Implement the application code:
   - Producer with SigV4a signing
   - Consumer for monitoring queues
   - Failover toggle mechanism

Let's start by creating the solution structure:

[*Amazon Q creates the solution structure and adds necessary NuGet packages*]

Now let's create the necessary files for our application. First, let's create the common models:

[*Amazon Q creates the SqsMessage class and other common components*]

[*Amazon Q continues to create the Producer and Consumer applications, including services for sending and receiving messages*]

[*Amazon Q creates CloudFormation templates for the AWS infrastructure*]

[*Amazon Q creates PowerShell scripts for deployment and failover toggling*]

[*Amazon Q creates a README file with instructions*]

## Updating the README with a Mermaid Diagram

**Human**: Update the readme to replace the architecture diagram placeholder image with a mermaid diagram

**Amazon Q**: I'll update the README.md file to replace the placeholder image with a Mermaid diagram that illustrates the architecture.

[*Amazon Q updates the README with a Mermaid diagram showing the architecture*]

## Adding Environment Variable Support

**Human**: update the Constants.cs and deploy.ps1 to preference pull data from environment variables before falling back to hardcoded defaults. Create a .env file that is passed in when running any of the dotnet commands, keeping the readme instructions up to date. Also create a .env.example with example values, including the copying of it to ".env" in the readme instructions. Create a .gitignore that makes sense for this repo, making sure to exclude the .env from being added to the repo.

**Amazon Q**: I'll update the project to use environment variables with fallbacks to default values, create .env files, and add a .gitignore file.

[*Amazon Q updates Constants.cs to use environment variables*]

[*Amazon Q updates deploy.ps1 to load variables from .env file*]

[*Amazon Q creates .env.example file*]

[*Amazon Q creates .gitignore file*]

[*Amazon Q updates toggle-failover.ps1 and reset-failover.ps1*]

[*Amazon Q updates README.md with new instructions*]

[*Amazon Q creates run-producer.ps1 and run-consumer.ps1*]

## Fixing PowerShell Script Issues

**Human**: Error when running deploy.ps1:

**Amazon Q**: I see the issue. The error is occurring because the null-coalescing operator (`??`) is not supported in older versions of PowerShell. Let me fix the PowerShell scripts to use a more compatible approach.

**Amazon Q**: I see the issue now. In PowerShell, the `param` block must be at the beginning of the script, not after other code. Let me fix all the scripts to follow the correct PowerShell syntax.

[*Amazon Q fixes the PowerShell scripts by moving the param block to the beginning*]

An error occurred (ValidationError) when calling the CreateChangeSet operation: Parameter 'PrimaryWeight' must be a number.

**Amazon Q**: I see two issues in the script:

1. The script is trying to use the application name as a region when deploying SQS queues
2. The Route53 setup is expecting numeric values for weights, but they're being passed as strings

Let me fix these issues:

[*Amazon Q fixes the deploy.ps1 script to properly handle region parameters and convert weight values to integers*]

[*Amazon Q fixes the toggle-failover.ps1 and reset-failover.ps1 scripts to use integer types for weights*]

**Human**: deploy.ps1 is expecting .env to be in the same folder as itself, but it's at the root

**Amazon Q**: I see the issue. The script is looking for the `.env` file in its current directory, but the file is actually located at the root of the project. Let me fix that.

[*Amazon Q updates the scripts to look for the .env file in both the current directory and the project root*]

**Amazon Q**: I've identified and fixed the issue with the application not finding the `appsettings.json` file. The problem was that when running the application from the root directory, it was looking for the configuration file in the wrong location.

What I found:

1. Both the Producer and Consumer projects already have `appsettings.json` files in their respective directories.
2. The error occurred because the application was being run from the root directory, but it was looking for the configuration file in that directory instead of in the project directory.

The solution:

I've updated both the `run-producer.ps1` and `run-consumer.ps1` scripts to:

1. Change the current directory to the respective project directory before running the application
2. Change back to the original directory after the application exits

This ensures that the application can find its configuration files correctly.

[*Amazon Q updates the run scripts to change directory before running the applications*]

**Human**: update the consumer so that when it logs that it received a message from a specific region, if the message comes from the east, the console log is green, otherwise it's blue

**Amazon Q**: I'll update the `MessageConsumerService` class to display messages in different colors based on the region they come from:

1. Messages from the US East region will be displayed in **green**
2. Messages from the US West region will be displayed in **blue**

Here's how I implemented this feature:

```csharp
// Set console color based on region
ConsoleColor originalColor = Console.ForegroundColor;
if (region.Contains("east", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
{
    Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Green;
}
else
{
    Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Blue;
}

// Log the message with color
Console.WriteLine($"Received message in {region}: {message}");

// Reset console color
Console.ForegroundColor = originalColor;
```

The key aspects of this implementation:

1. **Save the original color**: I store the current console color so we can restore it after displaying the message
2. **Set the appropriate color**: Green for East region, Blue for West region
3. **Write directly to the console**: Using `Console.WriteLine` instead of the logger to ensure the color is applied
4. **Reset the color**: Restore the original console color after displaying the message

This approach provides a clear visual distinction between messages from different regions, making it easier to see which region is handling the messages at a glance. The color coding will be particularly helpful when demonstrating the failover functionality, as you'll be able to immediately see when messages start arriving in the secondary region.

**Human**: This repo is going to be submitted to a contest about using Amazon Q. Update the readme with anything that you feel make sense based on the below competition prompt and info. Talk about the benefits of global availability of SQS, decoupling the producer from the failover status of the SQS queue and consumer. Use S3, Eventbridge, and GlobalAccelertor as examples of where multi-region availability has already been introduced as benefits to the AWS service, and how this strategy being applied to SQS can help accomplish similar.
